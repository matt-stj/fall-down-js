#### How to play

#### Instructions

Use the right and left arrow keys to direct the ball. When the ball passes through a gate, you score a point. Direct the ball toward the clock to slow down the game. The saw will cut the boards in half -- making it easier for you to advance. If the ball touches the ceiling, the game is over. High scores are displayed on the right and updated at the end of each game.
